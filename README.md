# Picnic Frogger
===============================
This arcade game is a picnic take on frogger. The little girl wants to go for a swim. But must pass the bugs to get into the water. The user navigates the bugs to get to the last line of rock in front of the water. The object of the game is to reach the water's edge before a bug collides with the little girl. If a bug collides, the user will return to the beginning of the game.
